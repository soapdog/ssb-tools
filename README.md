# ssb-tools

Some simple low-profile tools for working with [scuttlebutt](http://scuttlebutt.nz) built with [Red](http://www.red-lang.org). Check this [thread on scuttlebutt for more info](https://viewer.scuttlebot.io/%25rX2xUDO3zEhvlJyjsx9FaoX8r2MDbzpAxxPNhMzNcdw%3D.sha256)

## Requirements

You need to have Red installed to run these proof-of-concepts. None of them work right now.

# Sponsorships

Do you want a decentralized internet too? Are you worried about the loss of net neutrality and realized that radical decentralization is the way to fight back? Have some cryptobucks to spare? If you want to make a financial contribution to help me fund development of this and other dex focused software, I would love to receive contributions in the following cryptocurrencies:

* Ethereum: 0x0bd1bbb25cc9dd2ce8ea1fba4e333ff091f671a9
